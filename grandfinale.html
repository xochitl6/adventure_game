<h1>Garold sadly went back home, without hopping, just walking.</h1>
<h2>He passed by the goose and the aligator and finally the wolf, ready to apologize, but suddenly, he heard a loud SURPRISE!</h2>
    <h3>Turning around he saw the aligator and the goose, finally he saw the wolf, carying a giant carrot cake.</h3>
    <h4>All laughing and smiling, they ate the cake and lived happily ever after.</h4>
   
    <h5>THE END</h5>
